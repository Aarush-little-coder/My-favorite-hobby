        <h3>I love reading books</h3>
        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgable books in my free time. Whenever I go home from school, I like to read such types of books after completing my homework. I am 12 years old and read in 7th standard. Now I know that reading is a very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby could have been developed but I got it naturally. Reading books keeps one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. it makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly, a successful person in the life.</p>
